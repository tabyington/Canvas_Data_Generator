# README

This will be updated as I go

I lost a lot of work and my libraries when I left Instructure due to having to transfer my repos to them. It's fair enough, I wrote them to use for their testing. I'll have to make new ones before much work will progress here. 

There are a variety of data gen tools used within Instructure, it's like a QA flex to have your own datagen tool, but I believe all are cli and I still think this project will be useful to those outside Instructure. I will be using public api documentation found at https://canvas.instructure.com/doc/api/ and will not use any of my insider knowledge, which, tbf, is mostly available in the open source repo available here https://github.com/instructure/canvas-lms if you want to dig.

Canvas plugins are integrated via the LTI (Learning Tools Operability) standard. I don't know if I'll be needing this (I'll probably keep this data generator a standalone tool). https://www.1edtech.org/standards/lti
